;; Home row mods QWERTY example with more complexity.
;; Some of the changes from the basic example:
;; - when a home row mod activates tap, the home row mods are disabled
;;   while continuing to type rapidly
;; - tap-hold-release helps make the hold action more responsive
;; - pressing another key on the same half of the keyboard
;;   as the home row mod will activate an early tap action
